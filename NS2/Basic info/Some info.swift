 Certainly! Here are the Swift structures for the user and products, as well as a discussion on using an enum versus a struct for categories.

 ### Swift Structures

 #### User Struct

 ```swift
 import Foundation
 import FirebaseFirestoreSwift

 struct User: Identifiable, Codable {
     @DocumentID var id: String?
     var username: String
     var email: String
     var password: String // Note: Consider secure password handling and storage
     var address: String?
     var phoneNumber: String?
     var orderHistory: [String] = [] // Array of order IDs
 }
 ```

 #### Product Struct

 ```swift
 import Foundation
 import FirebaseFirestoreSwift

 struct Product: Identifiable, Codable {
     @DocumentID var id: String?
     var name: String
     var description: String
     var price: Double
     var category: ProductCategory
     var stock: Int
     var imageUrl: String?
     var alternativeProducts: [String] = [] // Array of alternative product IDs
 }
 ```

 #### Category Enum

 Using an enum for categories can be advantageous for type safety and easier handling of predefined categories.

 ```swift
 enum ProductCategory: String, Codable, CaseIterable {
     case womensHealth = "Women's Health"
     case babyAndChildCare = "Baby and Child Care"
     case fitnessAndWeightManagement = "Fitness and Weight Management"
     case alternativeMedicine = "Alternative Medicine"
     case mensHealth = "Men's Health"
     case firstAid = "First Aid"
     case digestiveHealth = "Digestive Health"
     case vitaminsAndSupplements = "Vitamins and Supplements"
 }
 ```

 ### Discussion: Enum vs. Struct for Categories

 #### Enum Advantages:
 1. **Type Safety:** Ensures that only valid categories can be used.
 2. **Ease of Use:** Easy to use in switch statements and UI components like pickers.
 3. **Consistency:** Prevents typos and ensures consistency across the app.
 4. **CaseIterable Conformance:** Provides a collection of all cases, useful for UI and logic that need to iterate over categories.

 #### Struct Advantages:
 1. **Flexibility:** Allows for dynamic categories, which can be useful if categories are fetched from a server or updated frequently.
 2. **Additional Properties:** Structs can store more complex data if categories need additional attributes (e.g., icons, descriptions).

 ### Example Usage of Enum in Product Struct

 Here's how you can use the `ProductCategory` enum in the `Product` struct:

 ```swift
 let product = Product(
     id: "1",
     name: "Pain Relief Cream",
     description: "A cream to relieve muscle pain",
     price: 15.99,
     category: .firstAid,
     stock: 20,
     imageUrl: "http://example.com/image.png",
     alternativeProducts: ["2", "3"]
 )
 ```

 ### Example Struct for Dynamic Categories (if needed)

 If you prefer to use a struct for more dynamic or complex categories, you can define it like this:

 ```swift
 struct Category: Identifiable, Codable {
     var id: String
     var name: String
     var description: String?
     var iconUrl: String?
 }

 // Update the Product struct to use Category
 struct Product: Identifiable, Codable {
     @DocumentID var id: String?
     var name: String
     var description: String
     var price: Double
     var category: Category
     var stock: Int
     var imageUrl: String?
     var alternativeProducts: [String] = []
 }
 ```

 In this case, you would fetch and manage categories dynamically, possibly from Firestore or another backend service.

 ### Conclusion

 For your pharmacy app, using an enum for categories is likely the best approach if your categories are fixed and known ahead of time. Enums provide type safety and are easy to manage. However, if you expect categories to change dynamically or require additional attributes, a struct would offer more flexibility.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ------------------------------
 Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you complete your pharmacy app project:

 ### **1. Planning and Requirements Gathering**
 - **Define Scope:** Outline the core features of your app (product catalog, stock management, user authentication, etc.).
 - **Legal Requirements:** Research the legal and regulatory requirements for selling pharmaceuticals in Argentina.
 - **Market Research:** Understand your target audience and their needs.

 ### **2. Project Setup**
 - **Set Up Development Environment:**
   - Install Xcode and set up your iOS development environment.
   - Set up a Firebase project and integrate Firebase SDK into your Swift project.
 - **Create a Git Repository:** Use version control to manage your codebase.

 ### **3. Design Phase**
 - **UI/UX Design:**
   - Create wireframes and mockups for your app using design tools like Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD.
   - Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface with a focus on accessibility.
 - **Database Schema:**
   - Plan your Firestore database structure (collections and documents for products, users, orders, etc.).

 ### **4. Development Phase**
 - **Set Up Firebase:**
   - Integrate Firebase into your Swift project and configure Firestore.
   - Set up Firebase Authentication for user management.
 - **Implement Core Features:**
   - **Product Catalog:** Develop the UI for displaying products and their details.
   - **Stock Management:** Implement real-time stock updates using Firestore streams.
   - **User Authentication:** Add sign-up, login, and profile management features.
   - **Search and Filter:** Implement search functionality and filters for products.
   - **Notifications:** Set up push notifications for stock updates and order status.
 - **Concurrency Management:**
   - Use async/await and Combine for handling asynchronous operations and real-time updates.
   
 ### **5. Testing Phase**
 - **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
 - **Integration Testing:** Test how different parts of the app work together.
